                    The agents implement the core functionality of trento. They
                    are responsible for the discovery of all the clustered components
                    that are required to run SAP Applications in a highly
                    available way. These agents implement discovery for:
                     - Pacemaker
                     - Corosync
                     - HANA

                    In the hosts overview, the user can get a list of all the
                    hosts that are running the trento agent. For each host it
                    will be possible to check basic information such as the hostname,
                    it's IP address, to what cluster it belongs and a list of all
                    the tags that have been set by the discovery mechanisms to
                    classify each host accordingly.

                    When accessing the details of each host, it will be possible
                    to access in-depth information about the role each host has
                    in the cluster such as the status of the core HDB processes,
                    SAP System ID (SID), etc.

                    Here, the SAP administrator can get a list of potential problems
                    and improvements on the configuration of the host that our
                    discovery mechanisms have found.

                    often to identify productive, development and quality assurance systems.
                    In this view we get an overview of the distribution of each SID, the number of
                    hosts disvered of each of them and additional details.
